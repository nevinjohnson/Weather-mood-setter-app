### Project Description
Weather Mood Setter App is a web application that detects the current weather in your chosen location and sets your mood with curated music, colors, or activity suggestions to match! It aims to brighten your day‚Äîrain or shine.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt that your mood doesn‚Äôt quite match the weather outside? Struggling to find the right playlist for a rainy day or a sunny afternoon? Clearly, a universal struggle!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We fetch real-time weather, analyze your atmospheric vibes, and serve you mood-setting music, themes, or activity ideas‚Äîbecause even the clouds need a DJ!
