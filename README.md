### Project Description
2Mood Setter is a calming, minimalist web app that changes based on real-time weather to match and enhance your mood. It blends smooth visuals, ambient themes, and optional user preferences using Supabase for a personalized, peaceful experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People spend hours overthinking, doom-scrolling, or staring into the void. I built Mood Setter to gently hijack that loop — by giving them a soothing, weather-matched escape that’s both pointless and peaceful. It’s like emotional aromatherapy... but for your screen. 🧘‍♂️🌧️✨

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I pair the user’s current weather with a perfectly matched vibe — calming visuals, sounds, and quotes — to hijack their mood and gently pull them out of the overthinking spiral. It’s like a virtual hug from the weather gods. 🌥️💆‍♀️🎶
